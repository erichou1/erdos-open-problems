RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED

0. Formalization

Let

F(N)=min{∣A∣:A⊆{0,1,…,N}, {0,1,…,N}⊆A−A}.

Equivalently, A is a set of ruler marks in [0,N] such that every distance 0,1,…,N occurs between two marks.

The target is to determine the real number L, if it can be proved to exist, such that

N→∞
lim
	​

N
	​

F(N)
	​

=L.

Quantifier form:

∃L∈R∀ε>0∃N
0
	​

∀N≥N

,
	​

N

F(N)

Negation:

∃N≥N

≥ε.

Basic forced facts:

If A−A contains N and A⊆[0,N], then the only way to realize distance N is

N−0=N.

Hence every admissible A must contain both 0 and N.

1. Verified elementary lower bound

Let ∣A∣=m. Each positive distance 1,…,N must be represented by some ordered pair (a,b)∈A
2
 with a>b. There are only

(
2
m
	​

)

such pairs.

Therefore

N≤(
2
m
	​

)=
2
m(m−1)
	​

.

So

m
2
−m−2N≥0,

hence

m≥
2
1+
1+8N
	​

	​

.

Thus

F(N)≥
2
1+
1+8N
	​

	​

,

and therefore

N→∞
liminf
	​

N
	​

F(N)
	​

≥
2
	​

.

This is rigorous but not sharp enough to determine the requested limit.

2. Verified elementary upper bound

Let

q=⌈
N
	​

⌉,t=⌊
q
N
	​

⌋.

Define

A={0,1,…,q−1}∪{q,2q,…,tq}∪{N}.

Then A⊆{0,…,N}.

We show that every n∈{1,…,N} lies in A−A.

Write n=kq−r, where 1≤k≤t and 0≤r≤q−1. Then

n=kq−r,

with kq∈A and r∈A, so n∈A−A. This covers all

1≤n≤tq.

Now suppose tq<n≤N. Since N=tq+s for some 0≤s<q, we have

N−n≤N−(tq+1)=s−1<q.

Thus N−n∈{0,1,…,q−1}⊆A. Therefore

n=N−(N−n)∈A−A.

So A is admissible.

Its size satisfies

∣A∣≤q+t+1≤q+
q
N
	​

+1.

Since q∼
N
	​

,

F(N)≤2
N
	​

+O(1),

and therefore

N→∞
limsup
	​

N
	​

F(N)
	​

≤2.

So we have rigorously proved

F(N)
	​

N→∞
limsup
	​

≤2.

This does not determine the exact limit.

3. Attempts toward the exact value

A sharper solution would need either:

N→∞
limsup
	​

N
	​

F(N)
	​

≤c

for some explicit smaller c, or

N→∞
liminf
	​

N
	​

F(N)
	​

≥c

matching the best construction.

I explored the following independent approaches:

Strategy	Result
Pair-counting	Gives 
2
	​

, insufficient.
Endpoint forcing 0,N∈A	True but alone gives no sharp constant.
Block construction using short interval plus arithmetic progression	Gives constant 2.
Symmetric endpoint construction	Still gives constant 2.
Three-block construction	Improves coverage structure but did not yield a verified constant below 2.
Multiplicity profile (r_A(d)=	{(a,b):a-b=d}
Gap-sequence analysis	Converts problem to covering all sums of consecutive gaps; no exact asymptotic derived.
Inductive extension N↦N+1	Too lossy for the asymptotic constant.
Product/composition construction	Gives admissible larger rulers but not a fixed exact limit constant.
Compactness of normalized rulers	Suggests limiting density structure, but no closed optimization proved.

	I did not produce a proof from first principles.

The main unresolved gap is:

GAP: determine the optimal asymptotic constant beyond the elementary interval [
2
	​

,2].

I did not close this gap.

4. What is rigorously established here

The following theorem is proved above.

Theorem. For all N≥1,

≤F(N)≤2

	​

+O(1).

Consequently,

I did not obtain a proof of the exact value of the limit.

I have not used WiFi, internet search, web search, external databases, retrieved documents, citations, or literature-status information. All reasoning was derived from the problem statement, explicit assumptions, definitions, and deductions performed within this session.
